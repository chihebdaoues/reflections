How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it helps me spot lines that changed in the code, so I can know where the
    bug was introduced

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can check what changed, I can go back to the previous version if this
    things go wrong. I can know who changed this and who's working on that.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I think that manually choosing when to commit is great, it avoids getting
    useless checkpoints, and gives the possibility to add a message, but it
    sometimes people tend to forget to commit and that can make a problem,
    best solution would be to remind them to commit after a period of time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because sometimes file change together or a change in one file impact an
    other file. other version control like Google Docs are meant for making
    only one file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives you the whole history and diff can output the difference
    between 2 checkpoints

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I stop being afraid of messing up the code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    do stuff

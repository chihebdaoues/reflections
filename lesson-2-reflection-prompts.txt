How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
  the staging area isn't a directory on it's own. it's just wrap for selected
  files, it's wraps the package of files that will be committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
  you can stage the changes and git diff --staged to compare with the last
  commit.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
  we can know who's the parent of who

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
  merging two branches gives you the part that changed in both branches, we
  represent it the way we do because it has two parents.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
  pros: helps with coping a lot of code, manually merges in case of problem
